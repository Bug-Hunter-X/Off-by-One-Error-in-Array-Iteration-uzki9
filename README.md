This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays.  The `bug.java` file contains the buggy code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code with the appropriate loop condition to avoid this error.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering array indices when writing loops in Java.
